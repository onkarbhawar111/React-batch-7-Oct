Task:
Create a custom React Hook named useLocalStorage that allows components to store and retrieve data from the browser’s localStorage.

Requirements:

The hook should:

Accept two parameters:

key → the name of the local storage item

initialValue → the default value if no stored data exists

Return an object containing:

value → the current stored value

setStoredValue → a function to update both the React state and the localStorage.

When the component using the hook updates the value, it should automatically save it to localStorage.

When the page reloads, the component should display the last saved value from localStorage.

Add a button to remove the saved item from localStorage.
